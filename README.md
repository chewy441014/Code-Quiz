# Code-Quiz

## Description

This web app is a ten question quiz on Javascript topics, for each wrong answer, 15 seconds is deducted and with a time limit of 75 seconds, this quiz is quite hard. I recommend doing it multiple times. At the end, your score will be recorded with your name or initials, and you can see high scores from anyone who has done the quiz on your web browser!  

## Usage

To use this web app, simply go to the Github pages [link]() and click start or view leaderboard if you'd like to scope out the competition first. If you run out of time, you get a score of zero, if you answer incorrectly and the time deduction reduces the time to zero, you get a score of zero. 

You cannot view the leaderboard while taking the quiz. The quiz is already hard, no need to add distractions! The quiz looks like this:
